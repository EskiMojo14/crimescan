# Crimescan

A web app displaying the statistics of crime in a specific area, within a given time period.

CrimeScan is built using TypeScript, React, Redux, and SCSS. It uses RMWC as a UI framework, and compiles using Webpack. There are a few basic unit tests using Jest, which can be run with `npm run test`.

## Codebase

Site code is stored in `/src`, and is built by running `npm run build` in the root directory. It compiles into `/public`.

Webpack's serve can be run with `npm start`. It gets hosted at `localhost:8080`.
